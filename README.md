# TODO: React concept exoloration

## Description
For my project I decided to explore and understand the concepts within the react framework. React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, or webpages, or single-page applications and uses building blocks (components) to create these applications. As mentioned before, React uses components to make the devlopment process much more modular and re-use peices of code throughout the framework. Thanks to the syntax extension JSX, we can also code html directly in JavaScript which makes the interface bulding much more hands on and simpler to do. In React, I showcase some of the concepts we learned in class, for example how functions can be used as values, callbacks and higher order functions, and abstract data types. I give simple examples that showcases the concepts and explain in further detail how its important, and how it connects back to our class learning. 

First I showcase an instance of a function being used as value, then showcase a callback and a simple instance of a higher order function, and finally create an element within our react framework that shows the power and utility of Abstract Data Types. As a result of this project, I was able to familiarize myself with a very powerful tool and now understand how many of the core concepts we learned in class apply to many different language models and frameworks. Without the core concepts we learned in class, React would not be as powerful as it is or as versatile as it could be.
## Repository Organization

TODO: My project has 2 example files, greeting.jsx and Button.jsx which showcase functions as values and callbacks/higher order functions. We have an App.jsx where we actually build our webpage and showcase these class concepts, and where we include a abstract data type example.
